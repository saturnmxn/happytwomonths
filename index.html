  <h2 style="font-family:trebuchet ms;"> <center> <span title="i love you forever<33"> <i> I love you andra. I love your eyes, your smile. I love the way you speak, the way you make me feel. You made me believe in love, you convinced me that it was possible for me too. You are the reason why I still smile. I haven't eaten any butterflies my whole life, but the day I met you, my stomach felt full. I can't describe the feeling I felt when I met you, all I know is that I felt joy for the very first time. I would've never thought that I would think of you every day. You are like a star in the universe, you were impossible to be mine, yet here we are. You're the moon that glows in the dark night sky, you light me up when I'm blue. Love songs had no meaning to me, but when you came into my life, it was all about you. I never thought you'd be the one who would hold my heart. All the beautiful things in the world remind me of you. With you, heaven is still near for me to touch every night I thank the stars that someone as beautiful as you chose me. At first, I thought you wouldn't notice my efforts, I would've never thought that you actually liked me back. Even if we are far from each other, I promise that I'll love you no matter what. I promise you that I'll never leave your side. We love each other and no one can stop us from being together. I want to grow old with you, and watch the sunset with you. You are my first, last, and only love. Happy 2 months to us andra<33 </i> </span>
